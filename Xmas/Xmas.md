What is it?
-----------
Chrismas is coming - sooner or later :)

Let's help Santa Claus to keep his gifts list secure. We want to achieve local encryption of the present description but keep information like to whom the present is for, clear and searchable. Let's see how we encrypt some data into local storage.

Xmas app shows you how to use [aerogear-crypto-ios](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-crypto-ios). Using AeroGear crypto lib, you can easily do private key encryption (also called symmetric encryption).

System requirements
-------------------
- iOS 7.X
- Xcode version 6.1.1 and later

Build and Deploy Xmas
---------------------

The project uses [cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org). As a pre-requisite, install [cocoapods](http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-0.36/) and then install the pod. On the root directory of the project run:

```bash
pod install
```

and then double click on the generated .xcworkspace to open in Xcode.
