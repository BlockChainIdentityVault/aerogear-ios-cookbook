# PipeDemo

This is the source code for the demo application built on the [Getting Started Guide with XCode and iOS](http://aerogear.org/docs/guides/GetStartedwithAeroGearandXcode/) tutorial. 

## Running the app:

The project requires [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) for dependency management;

### SETUP

_BEFORE_ you can run the app, you need to run the following command inside of the AeroGear-TODO folder:

    pod install

Now you are almost done! You just need to open the AeroGear-TODO.xcworkspace in order to run the TODO app!

Enjoy!
